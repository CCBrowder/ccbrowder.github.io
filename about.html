    <h2>Born to be a Star</h2>
        <h3> Jakwon Moore knew from an early age that he was going to be a star - but he didn't necessarily know where or how. After coming up through the Pender County Recreational Basketball and then the North Carolina AAU system, Jakwon, who up until the age of 14 was a multi-sport athlete including Basketball, Football, Soccer, and Badminton, decided to take the next leap and dedicate the entirety of his time to basketball. After being accepted to Word of God Academy, the alma mater of prestigious NBA players like John Wall, Jakwon has been a force on the team for the past 4 years, propelling a winning squad that has made serious tries at the State Championship. With offers including LSU, South Carolina, Texas A&M, and Wake Forest, Jakwon is poised to be a ready contributor for any P5 team from day one. If you want a proven leader, a steady lockerroom voice, and a lethal shooter on the court, Jakwon is your man. </h3>
